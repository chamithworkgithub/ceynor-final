                                    <li>“The authorities encourage fishermen to be their own boss. The Goelette Blanche Fishermen Association received a grant from the Ministry of Fisheries and the European Union which enabled it to purchase a semi-industrial fishing boat for expeditions in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Mauritius. With a capacity of 5 tons of fish, the boat is going to sea in a month.”</li>

                                    <li>This vessel bearing number 59.5 - CN - MD - 05 is the last vessel of the project related to the production of 59.5 feet long vessels given by the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources under the 50% subsidy system.</li>
                                    <li>It can be pointed out that the primary objective of starting this project in association with the Fishery Department and Cey - Nor Foundation is to reduce post-harvest wastage and to introduce multi-day fishing vessels to the community engaged in the fishery industry using modern technical equipment with cold storage facilities.</li>
                                    <li>The fish resources harvested by the fishermen must be distributed to the consumer with high quality. The vessel is equipped with all modern technology to reduce wastage during storage, landing, selection of fish harvest, sale, and transportation of the fish harvested by the vessels. </li> 
                                    
                                  </ul>

                                  <li>This vessel includes two fish holders of 18 Cum3 size and one fish holder is equipped with a refrigeration system with a temperature of -10 degrees Celsius. The other Fish Holder can be used to store ice. </li>
                                  <li>A refrigeration system with a temperature of -20 degrees Celsius installed in the Bait Holder can also keep the quality of the fish harvested without damage.</li>
                                  <li>The stability of this vessel with Long Line Winch has been received and the vessel is manufactured in accordance with the specifications approved by the Ministry of Fisheries.</li>
                                  <li>This vessel includes a 400 HP Marine Diesel engine and a 25 KVA generator. The speed here is between 10-12 knots. Due to the VMS (Vessel Monitoring System) system installed on the vessel, the location of the vessel can be confirmed from the land. This vessel is equipped with modern technical equipment such as GPS, Fish Finder, Navigation Light, and Bilge Pump System. The AIS receiver system which helps to identify the vessel in water from other vessels has given added value to this vessel.</li>
                                  <li>The value of this 59.5 feet vessel is Rs.35 million, and Cey - Nor Foundation provides a one-year warranty to its customer for fiberglass manufacturing defects. </li>
